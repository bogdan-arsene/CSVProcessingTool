## Eingesetzte Technologien / Frameworks

I use the following technologies / frameworks in my project:

How to use:
1. Import your .csv file using the 'Choose a File' button then click 'Import'

    * It will automatically scroll the page down to the added record
    * You can click on 'Back To TOP' to return to the top of the page
